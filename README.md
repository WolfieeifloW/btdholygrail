## Using BTDiablo Holy Grail
• Check (or uncheck!) the items you've collected in your adventures in BTDiablo. The grail will automatically update, and you can view your grails progress on the Statistics tab.

• The grail uses your browsers Local Storage to automatically save your progress. **<ins>Please note</ins>** that Local Storage *can* get cleared out. Clearing your browsers cache, cookies, and/or other site data can clear it out.  
• Also please note - if you use your browsers incognito mode that your Local Storage **<ins>will</ins>** be wiped upon closing Incognito. So, if you use Incognito, **<ins>definitely</ins>** use the Save button before closing your browser.

• The Save button will export your grail as a JSON file. This file can be imported via the Load button to restore your grail.  
• This is useful for backing up your grail, or if you switch computers or browsers.
